# Front End Interview Handbook

## General Tips

Be extremely familiar with the following concepts:

- CSS: Specificity, Box model, Layout, Positioning
- JavaScript: this keyword, Prototypes, closures, Async-style code, Promises, Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
- JavaScript design patterns: Observer pattern, Module pattern
- HTML: Event delegation (it was useful in almost every interview), DOMtraversal, DOM manipulation, Form validation and submission
- Vanilla JS, or jQuery at the very least. Not all interviews allow you to use React as they want to see mastery of the fundamentals
